<!-- I had to break a few rules on this one in the name of art and homework. 
Using H tags for capitalization is apparently not a best practice, and using 
the center tag is also considered obsolete. With that said 
I needed away to capitalize my text properly. 
This will suffice for now, but if I need to come back to this 
project at any point, then I need to update it with a css document, remove the center tags, and 
reorganize the H tags. Also i intentionally created a merge conflict by simultaneously editing the 
main and feature branches to see what it was like to resolve. Its fairly easy because it tells you what 
the conflict is and provides a web editor to amend the code. As a quick side note, I love 
the art piece that Dall-E made me. One final thing to note is that I was not able to use li tags because 
It dropped bulletin points on the wrong side of the page  That could not be centered with the outdated 
center tag -->
